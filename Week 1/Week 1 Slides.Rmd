# Welcome to class!

We will use a Google Doc to structure much of today's class since there is not a huge need to use slides for what we will be doing.

In future weeks we will _probably_ be using slides, but this may change as we progress...

(this will depend on how much we think we need to use slides in class to structure discussion)
